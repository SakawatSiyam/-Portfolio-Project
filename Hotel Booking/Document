In recent years, both City Hotel and Resort Hotel have experienced elevated cancellation rates. 
Consequently, both establishments are confronted with several challenges, such as reduced 
revenue and suboptimal utilization of their hotel rooms. As a result, a paramount objective 
for both hotels is to reduce cancellation rates, thereby enhancing their revenue-generating 
efficiency. Our aim is to provide comprehensive business recommendations to address this 
issue.
